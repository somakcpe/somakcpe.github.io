(c)	C
 -   Carbon dioxide produced during respiration by living organisms
present in the soil<p>
	
        Turns lime water milky.<p>

D
 -   The lime water remains clear because the living organisms in the
soil had been<p>

         Killed,
therefore no respiration occurred and no carbon dioxide was released.
