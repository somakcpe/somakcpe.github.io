gently and iodine solid will sublimate and settle on the cold watch 
glass .The remaining  mixture  add  water  to it. salt will  dissolve

In gaseous state , the particles  are far
	apart  and  free to more randomly in all directions hence   no
	definite  shape  and volume.<p>
	

<img src="f1c17b.jpg" ><p>

In  solid state ,the particles  are closely 
	packed  together  and can  only vibrate  within fixed    positions 
	hence shape and volume<p>

BC-   The temperature remains
constant until all the solid melts. Here, the heat supplied is used
to      weaken forces of attraction holding the particles  of the
solid together.<p>
CD-   Temperature rises steadily as
the liquid of the pure substance absorbs heat energy .The heat
supplied  increases further ,the kinetic  energy  of the particles 
causing them to move fast.<p>
