<u><b>SECTION
C.</b></u><p>
23( a)Factors
considered when spacing crops 
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Soil fertility
	status.-crops can be spaced wider if the soil is infertile and
	closer of soil is fertile.<p>
	<li>Soil moisture
	rainfall in the area &ndash; Drier areas require wider spacing than
	wet areas.<p>
	<li>Machinery to be
	used in subsequent farm operations.-A crop whose operation will be
	given a wider spacing to allow for movement, of machinery that which
	will be manually transferred.<p>
	<li>Intended
	purpose of the crop.- Crops grown as fodder for annual can be spaced
	c loosely.eg maize for silage is spaced closer than that grown for
	grains.<p>
	<li>Growth
	habit/size/suckering/tilling % of the crop. &ndash; P plants that
	tiller or produce suckers or those that occupy a wide area should 
	be widely spaced. Those that grow upward require closer spacing.<p>
	<li>Cropping system
	&ndash; whether pure stand or mixed stand. Wider spacing is required
	for a crop to be interplant than in a pure stand.<p>
	<li>Height &ndash;
	Shorter crops require narrower spacing than taller crops.<p>
	<li>Number of
	spacing per hole- If more seeds are planted per hole the spacing 
	should be wider than fewer or one seed planted per hole.<p>
	<li>Mark any 6
	points 	1 mark stating 1x6 =6<p>
</ul>
			1 mark
explaining 1x6 =6   
<p>
			Total 12 marks<p>
(b) Describe the
process of chemic al water treatment<p>
Stage 1:&rsquo;
Filtration at the water intake. eater is made to pass through a sense
that trap large particles.<p>
Stage 2:
Softening of water<p>
The water is 
made to circulate in a small tank where it is mixed with a soda
ash(sodium bicarbonate ate and aluminium sulphate.<p>
Soda ash softens
the water<p>
Aluminium
facilitates coagulation and sedimentation of soil particles<p>
Stage 3 :
Coagulation, sedimentation aeration  bottom a large open tank.<p>
Water stays here
for at least 36 hours to kill bilharzias wormed<p>
The tank is left
open for aeration in order to facilitate filtratiuon.Water passes
into filtration tank where all the remaining solid particles are
trapped and removed.<p>
This is
facilitated by the tank having layers of different sizes of gravel
and sand.<p>
Stage 5:
Chlorination<p>
Filtered water
enters the chlorination tank where small amounts of chlorine solution
are added to kill micro-organisms .The amount t of chlorine is
controlled by a dozer.<p>
STERP 6. Storage
and distribution.<p>
Treated water is
stored in large tanks before being distributed by consumers<p>
Mark the  5
stages in order<p>
2 x5= 10 marks<p>



<p>
24(a)  Uses of
farm records<p>
<ul>
	<li>Guide farmers
	in plan ting and budgeting<p>
	<li>Show whether
	the farmers in making profit or loss.<p>
	<li>Show history of
	the farm<p>
	<li>Help to
	determine a farmers t worth insets<p>
	<li>Help in sharing
	of profit or losses in partnerships or cooperation bans<p>
	<li>Help in
	comparison of performance of different enterprises in the farm.<p>
	<li>Help in
	settling disputes among liars if the farmer dies without a will<p>
	<li>Help to support
	insurance claims in the event of death or fire<p>
	<li>Help to remind
	farmers about his depts. Laborers so as to pay so as to repay in
	time<p>
	<li>Provide labour
	information such as when paying terminal benefits and pensions and
	NSSf dues.<p>
	<li>Help in select
	ion of breed stock, culling unproductive animals.<p>
	<li>Help to detect
	thefts or loss cases  on the farm.<p>
	<li>Help farmers in
	making sound management decisions 
	<p>
	<li>Help to
	pinpoint weakness on the farm business or areas that need
	improvement or reorganization<p>
</ul>
(b) Ways in which
soil loses fertility 
<p>
<ul>
	<li>Leaching &ndash;
	As more waters moves down the soil horizons it carries along soil
	nutrients  allow  the soil profile beyond the reach of the plant
	roots<p>
	<li>Soil erosion &ndash;
	Detaching and carrying away of top fertile soil leads to loss of
	fertile soil 
	<p>
	<li>Burning of
	vegetation &ndash;This destroys organic matter, beneficial organ
	isms that breakdown organic matter to realize nutrients are also
	destroyed.<p>
	<li>Change in soil
	ph &ndash; Due to prolonged use of acid or basic fertile ph
	determine the type of micro-organisms present and the availability
	of certain nutrients to crops.<p>
	<li>Monocropping-
	The practice of growing one type of crop  in the same place of land
	for a long time. There is  depletion of certain nutrients and from a
	certain zone in the soil<p>
	<li>Contour
	cropping- Crops absorb large amount of nutrients which get lost if
	they are never replenished back to the soil<p>
	<li>Accumulation of
	salts &ndash; Under irrigation in semi- arid areas, there is a high
	evaporation rate leading to accumulation of salts .This causes
	Salinization and destruct ion soil structure if leads to loss of
	soil fertility<p>
	<li>Development of
	hard pans- These prevents water infiltration into the soil proper
	development of crop roots.<p>
	<li>Fixation of
	nutrients into insoluble farms &ndash; Some nutrients become fixed
	hence are not readily available to crops<p>
