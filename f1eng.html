<b>SECTION
D: READING COMPREHENSION (20MKS)</b><p>

<b>Read
the passage and answer the questions that follow:-</b><p>

<u>The
communicative power of the English language</u><p>

Once
it used to be said that &quot;the sun never sets on the British
Empire&quot;. This meant that the British Empire covered all the time
zones, so that when the sun was setting on one part of the Empire, it
was rising on another.<p>


The
same thing can be said about the English language today. English is
spoken as a first language in the United Kingdom, Ireland, the United
States of America, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. It is also
spoken in the Caribbean countries like Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago,
and Guyana among others. In addition to this, English is used as a
second language in over fifty countries spread across Africa and
Asia. This means that when you have a good command of English you can
enjoy the writings of people from all over the world, and you can
communicate your ideas beyond the borders of this continent.<p>


We
in East Africa embraced the English language accidentally through the
colonial experience. English came in as a welcome addition to our
already rich language situation of over forty local languages and
Kiswahili. In fact the majority of Kenyans today are <u>multilingual</u>.
They use at least three languages: a local language, Kiswahili and
English. A good number of others speak a fourth language which may be
either French, Spanish, German, Japanese or Arabic among others.<p>


The
local or ethnic language bonds a person to the history, culture and
religious traditions of his or her people. If you speak one of the
ethnic languages, for example, you are able to enjoy the songs,
dances, stories, proverbs and riddles in that language. It also helps
you to communicate with the older folks who may not understand
English or Kiswahili.<p>


Kiswahili
is the national language in Kenya and is used by people from all the
ethnic groups. When one speaks and understands Kiswahili, one can
communicate with people from all over Kenya. Kiswahili is in fact a
&quot;regional language&quot;, because it is spoken in a number of
countries in East and Central Africa. Lately, Kiswahili was indeed
<u>adopted</u>
as one of the working languages at African Union meetings. Kiswahili,
therefore, opens opportunities beyond the borders of Kenya.<p>


After
Kenya attained independence, English was retained as the official
language because it was, and still is, a great advantage for many of
our operations. Though the original speakers of English were the
people living in the British Isles, English is now spoken as a first
language in two other continents, North America and Australia. It is
also the second language for millions of people living all over the
world. Therefore, with English you can be<p>

at
home anywhere in the world. English provides us with a powerful link
to the global village.<p>


Recent
developments in modern technology have enhanced our ability to speak,
read, write and understand English well. Many of the computer
programmes available, for example, are made to respond to instruction
given in English.<p>


English
is also important for participation at the international level. Many
reports and records on recent developments, science and other special
research are in English. There is much more written literature in
English than there is in any other language. Therefore, a student who
can read and write English well is at an advantage.<p>


In
international news broadcasting, users of English are greatly
advantaged. The <u>prominent
</u>international
news networks broadcast in English. English thus enjoys a prestigious
position in the communication of events taking place in the world.<p>


For
those who want to be part of what is happening in the world, English
is a very important tool. What does this mean for those of us in
Africa and Asia, where English is learned mainly in school? There is
need to put a lot of effort in the teaching and learning of this
language so that we can be part of the <u>vast</u>
changes taking place in the world today.<p>

<b>Read
the following story and answer the questions that follow</b><p>
<u>The
Monkey and The Crocodile</u><p>
A
long long time ago. Monkey and Crocodile were very good friends. The
Monkey&rsquo;s house was close to a river and there were many fruit
trees on the banks of this river.<p>

Usually
monkey would sit on the branches of the fruit trees and chat with his
friend Crocodile who would be basking on the banks of the river.
Their friendship continued for a long time until they decided it was
time to introduce their wives to this friendship. &quot;We have been
friends for a long time and you don&rsquo;t even know my house,
Crocodile began. 
<p>

&quot;Neither
do you know mine,&quot; Monkey replied. &quot;It is easier for you to
come to my-house that it is for me to visit you since I cannot swim
and your house is beyond the water.&quot;<p>

That
is not a problem. I can always carry you on my back,&quot; responded
crocodile. &quot;Let us visit my house first. My wife is a very good
cook,&rdquo; Monkey argued. &ldquo;No&rdquo; replied Crocodile &ldquo;My
wife has had a baby and there is plenty to eat in the house.&rdquo;<p>

Let
us not argue about this,&rdquo; Monkey said.&rdquo;If we go to my
house first, my wife will not be anxious when I tell her I am going
across the waters to visit you.&quot; They agreed that they would
visit Monkey's house first. Though at first Monkey's wife was afraid
of crocodile, she later realized that Crocodile was very friendly.
She did not have problems with her husband visiting him. In fact she
wished she would join him.<p>

Monkey
was very excited the following day when he got to the banks of the
river and found Crocodile waiting for him. This was going to be
Monkey's first trip across the waters and he could not hide his
excitement. He jumped onto Crocodile's back and Crocodile swiftly
swam towards the deep waters.<p>

When
they were in the middle of the river, crocodile slowed down and
began, laughing.<p>

&quot;Why
are you laughing?&quot; Monkey asked in surprise &quot;You fool. Did
you think I would take you to my house? I have waited for that heart
of yours for a long time. Today I have it.&rdquo;<p>
Immediately
Monkey knew he was in deep trouble. He started thinking of a way out
of his predicament.<p>

&quot;Poor
you, my friend: Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this earlier?&quot;
Monkey calmly asked. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Crocodile in
surprise &quot;It is not difficult for me to give you my heart. If
you had asked when we were at my house. I would even have given you
my wife's heart too,&quot; Monkey replied. 


Crocodile
was confused.

<p>

&quot;Then
why don't you give it to me now?&quot; Crocodile asked.

You
see my friend; Monkeys have a tradition of leaving their hearts at
home when they are going for a long journey. I therefore left mine on
my favourite tree.&quot; Crocodile was even more confused.




&quot;We
can go and visit your wife first, and then I will give you my heart
when you take me back,&quot; Monkey suggested.




&quot;No,&quot;
cried crocodile &quot;I will take you back first. When 1 have your
heart, we can then visit my wife.&quot;




Quickly,
Crocodile headed back to the bank of the river. When they got there,
monkey jumped from Crocodile's back onto his favourite tree. He asked
crocodile to open is mouth wide to receive the heart. Monkey then
picked the biggest of the mangoes on the tree and threw it into
Crocodile's open mouth. It fell in with a thud, breaking four of
Crocodile's teeth. Crocodile was so upset but there was nothing he
could do as Monkey jumped from tree to tree insulting him.

From
that day Monkey and Crocodile have remained enemies. And that is the
end of my story and may I not end like it.
