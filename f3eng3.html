Culture<p>

There
are many detailed descriptions of funerals child naming occasions and
other traditional institutions such as wife inheritance bride price,
marriage and polygamy.<p>




Child
naming as portrayed in this novel is a &ldquo;complicated&rdquo;
issue that involves the living and the dead who send in their
&ldquo;applications or demand to be immortalized by having their
names given to the new- borns. The livings have a say and choose whom
to name their children after. Akoko for example, chooses to name her
daughter Nyabera after the late Chief Odero Goghi<p>




A
child can take several names for several reasons Akoko is names after
the season of her birth ( Adeyo) after an ancestral spirit who sends
a vivid dream (Akelo) and after an uncle who had died recently 
(Obanda) she is given a fourth name Akoko for being noisy.<p>



Marriage
and payment of dowry are described in great detail. The father of the
bride decided the man who would be paid. The bride has no say in
determing her husband to be. She merely makes an appearance during
the negotiations in which her husband to be and his people have the
chance to assess her physical attributes. The father of the bride
groom determines the amount of the bride price. The bridegroom people
have a chance to bargain to an acceptable amount.<p>

Once
the bride price is paid young men from the husbands village have to
steal the newly married girl to her husband&rsquo;s home. There is a
mock fight between the thieves and the young men of the bride&rsquo;s
village and the bride resists the attempt to take her away from the
parents by screaming loudly.<p>



The
institution of marriage is treated with outmost respect and
separation of divorce is permitted only under rare circumstances such
as witchcraft being practiced by either of the two parties. Marriage
disputes are settled by a council of elders who keenly listen to both
sides of the story, for instances, the dispute between Akojo and
Owour Kembo.<p>



After
death, mourning is a communal affair. When Obura dies, Akoko leads
the village in mourning the Chief&rsquo;s son and they give him a
befilting farwell as a warrior. In the absence of Obura&rsquo;s body
a banana truck is buried to symbolize his body and the mock funerals
allow the villagers to express their emotion. Obura&rsquo;s agemates
stage mock fights while the mother leads the villages in singing
dirges with Obura&rsquo;s dirgers with Oburas spear and shield in her
hands.<p>
