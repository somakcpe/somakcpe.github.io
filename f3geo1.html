	leads to loss of soil fertility leading to a decrease in crop
	production.<p>
	<li>Reduced food
	production can lead to famine in the affected areas.<p>
	<li>Desertification
	leads to destruction of water catchment areas/insufficient supplies
	of water for<p>
</ul>
domestic
use.<p>
<ul>
	<li>Drying up of
	vegetation due to desertification leads to exposure of land to
	agents of erosion.<p>

	may trigger migration from the affected areas due to drought and
	decreasing<p>

production.<p>
<ul>
