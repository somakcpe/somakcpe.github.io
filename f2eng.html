<b>Comprehension
(20mks) </b>
<p>
<b>Read
the passage below and answer the questions that follow </b>
<p>
There     are     varied     opinions     as     to     what     real     pleasure     ought to be. However, this is one view which approaches this controversial 
topic from the positive angle and lays down certain tests which true pleasure must satisfy.<p>
Firstly, no pleasure can be right if its effects on the person who indulges in it are harmful. There are pleasures which can injure a man's body and which, 
in the end, can have permanent ill-effect on his health. There are pleasures which can coarsen a man's moral fibre and lower his resistance against that which is wrong. 
Any pleasure which leaves a man less physically fit, less mentally alert, less morally sensitive is wrong.<p>
There are obvious instances of this. Excessive use of alcohol lowers  a     man’s     power     of     self-control     and     renders     him     liable  to do 
things which he would not have done if he had been soberly  master of himself.  The taking  of drugs and stimulants can end in leaving  a  man      a      physical      wreck.     <b> Over-indulgence </b> in      eating      and      drinking      can  
leave     a     man     a     burden     to     himself,     with     his     physical     fitness  seriously impaired.  
Promiscuous sexual relationships can leave a man with  the    most    tragic    of    diseases    which    will    not    only    ruin    his    own    life,    but will be passed on to his children.<p> 
One     of     the     simplest  tests     of     pleasure     is:     What     does  it     do     to     the  man    who    indulges    in    it?    If    it    is    actively    harmful,    or    even    if    it    has    a built-in risk in it. it cannot be right. <p>
Secondly,    no    pleasure    can    be    right  if    its    effect    on    others    is    harmful.  There    are    pleasures    which    can    result  in    the    corruption    of    other    people,  
either     physically     or     morally.     To     teach     others  to     do     wrong,     to     invite  them to  do.  or to  make it easier for them to  do  so.  cannot be right.  To lake drugs should not be painted as adventurous and free.  An <u>illicit  relationship</u>, 
similarly, should not be presented as a beautiful friendship. Experiment with things which experience has proved to be disastrous cannot be looked on as the assertion of freedom.<p>
Thirdly.     pleasure     which     becomes  an     addiction     can     never     be     right.  One    of    the    old    Greeks    said    that  there    were    only    two    questions    about  
any    pleasure:  'Do    1    possess    it    or    am    I    possessed    by    it?' ‘Do    I    control   it    or    does  it    control    me?'    The    minute    a    man    feels    that    some    pleasure  
is    gripping    him    in    such    a    way    that    he    cannot    do    without    it,    he    will    be well advised to break it before it breaks him. <p>
Addiction     can     happen     with     things     like     tobacco     and     alcohol:  it can also    happen    with    drugs,    so    that    a    man    becomes    hooked    on    some    drugs  
and    thereby    become    a    slave    to    them.    It  is    better    to    have    nothing    to    do  with     pleasure     which     is  liable     to     become     an     addiction.     It  is     essential,  
the moment we become aware of the growing addiction, to stop.<p> 
Fourthly,    a    pleasure    is    wrong    if,    to    enjoy    it,  the    essentials    of    life  have    to    take    second    place.    A    pleasure    should    not    cost  too    much,    even  
if it is    a    good    thing    in    itself.    A    man    may    spend    on    a    game    time    and   money     which     should     have     gone     to     his     home     and     family.     Anything     in  
life that gets out of proportion is wrong. Whenever any pleasure <u>annexes</u> time and money which should have gone to things and to people in life of even greater importance, then, however fine it is in itself, it is wrong.

	<b>Read
	the narrative below and answer the questions that follow:</b><p>
	This 
	thing happened long time ago when people first appeared on earth. One
	day, the people were told that if they didn't want to die, 
	they should send chameleon with a fat piece of meat to take to the
	moon who would pass it to
	God.<p>  They  were also  told  to  give Lizard  a hoe to  take to  the moon.  
	Then,  if Chameleon  reached  the moon  with  the fat piece of meat before Lizard  with  the hoe. 
	the people would not die. but would live forever.<p>
	That day.  the people never slept a wink.  They  stayed  awake throughout the night and  early  the next morning.  
	They  sent Chameleon  far ahead  of lizard. However,  on  the way.  the temptation  to  taste the succulent appetizing  piece of meal proved  too  great,  so  Chameleon  stopped  to  taste a little meat.  
	The meat proved  to  be tender and  juicy  and  chameleon  ended  up  eating  a chunk  of it.  The remaining  piece that was to  be taken  to  the moon  became dirty,  covered  with soil.  
	Once Chameleon  realized  that he was late,  he lowered  the meat down from his back  and  begun  to  hurry,  dragging  it along.  
	As Chameleon  hurried along,  all the other animals stared  at him.  sniggered  and  hid  away.  But of course, most of them have been  envious of Chameleon  for the important errand  on which  he had  been  sent.  
	So  they  were happy  to  see that he had  failed.  By  the time Chameleon  reached  the moon,  with  the dirty  piece of meat.  Lizard  had already    handed    the    hoc    over    to    the    moon    and    man    thus    lost 
	the golden opportunity    to    acquire    immortality.    “The    moon    chased    away    the    Chameleon and  threw  the  dirty  piece  of  meat  after  him.  The  hoe  which  lizard  carried  was  	used  by  the  Luo  to  dig  graves  and  bury  their  dead.  
	Death  had  been  born.<p> Since   that   time   that   Chameleon   messed   up   the   Moon's   gift   meat,   the   type   of death  from  which  an  individual  would  die  is  fixed  right  on  the  day  of  his  or  her 
	birth!   And   initially   death   didn't   conic   secretly   to human beings. Death just sent word to whoever he wanted to take away to get 
	ready on a particular day. But since no  one liked  to  die.  people used  to  give death  a hard  time.  He always had to  chase one person  for days.  
	before he overpowered  and  caught him.  People used  all soils of tricks to  evade death,  so  he decided  to  come secretly  and  catch them unawares. That's why human beings never know the date they die.<p>
