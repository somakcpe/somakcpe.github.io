<u><b>THE
DETOX DEBATE</b></u><p>
Detox
kits and supplements are recent health feds. But can they really help
you lose weight fast? Online weight loss coach Adrew Cate
investigates.<p>
	We&rsquo;ve
heard a lot about the need to detox lately. It is the term used to
describe a strict program of elimination and supplementation that&rsquo;s
meant to rid your body of impurities, cleaning your liver and
kidneys, and flushing your bowel. It&rsquo;s suggested that toxins
build up from consuming too much fat, sugar, alcohol, caffeine,
preservatives, and pollution.<p>
There&rsquo;s
no shortage of detox books, kits, and programs claiming to help you
shed weight, improve your well being, cause your skin to radiate, and
make you feel younger. The kits usually contain a dietary program,
which is supplemented with a variety of vitamins, minerals, tonics,
digestive aids, and laxatives. They are particularly popular in
January as people feel the urge to begin the New Year afresh after
<u>overindulging</u>
during the festive season.<p>
	People
will make drastic changes when they go on a detox diet and often feel
better for starting a structured regime. However, detox kits made up
of herbal <u>laxatives</u>
and diuretics are unnecessary and have generally to have no blood of
fats, alcohol, and other nasties &ndash; all without the help of a
fancy box from your local pharmacy. There is no scientific evidence
to support specific detox diets, programs, or supplement kits.
However, there&rsquo;s no debate about the fact that eating less junk
food, cutting out cigarettes and your alcohol intake, etc will
benefit your health. For example, drinking more water and cutting out
caffeine will improve your hydration levels, while reducing your
portion sizes and increasing your vegetable intake will improve bowel
function. These changes will enhance your well-being, but there&rsquo;s
nothing magical about the detox diet itself. Rather, it&rsquo;s the
associated lifestyle changes that benefit your health.<p>
	Detox
kits that contain <u>laxatives</u>
and diuretics to encourage you to fast could, potentially, do more
harm than good. Laxatives speed up your bowel motions, but also
prevent the absorption of nutrients, while diuretics can result to
partial dehydration.<p>
The
fasting components of a detox should only be minimal, and not extend
beyond a day or two. By eating next to nothing, you are not getting
enough nutrients for the essential functions of your body.
Supplements are no substitute for real food, and relying solely on
them can result in vitamin <u>deficiencies</u>.
Fasting is also known to slow down your metabolic rate, which
encourages your body to store fat, making it harder to lose body fat
in the future.<p>
If
you&rsquo;ve spent weeks, months or years <u>overindulging</u>
drinking and smoking you can&rsquo;t hope to fix yourself in a few
days. Detox diets aren&rsquo;t an instant cure to health and
wellness. Short-term changes to your diet and lifestyle over the long
term, there&rsquo;s no point starting them, as they won&rsquo;t have
any serious impact upon your health.<p>

<i><b>Read
the story below and then answer the questions that follow;</b></i><p>
<u><b>KAHURU
THE CROW</b></u><p>
One
day Wamabuku, the rabbit decided to give a party. He invited all the
other animals that had invited him before to similar parties. For the
party Wamabuku had slaughtered many fat goats and cows. On the day of
the party, Wamabuku got all his servants to decorate his house for
the fiesta. All the animals arrived in rapid succession &ndash;
Wamuthige the hyena and his family, Wamacege the porcupine, Kahuru
the crow and may others.<p>
The
animals ate the meat to their satisfaction. After the meal they began
to dance. In the evening, the party was over and animals prepared to
leave. Wamuthige the hyena and his family being greedy animals
decided to get more meat from Wamabuku was surprised at their greed
and decided to teach them a lesson. Wamabuku told the hyena that only
the &ldquo;undesirable&rdquo; fat meat was remaining. Since hyena
love fat meat their mouths became moist with saliva.<p>
Wamabuku
then sent his servants to the garden to collect all his young
thriving gourds. The gourds were split into halves. The succulent
white inside called &ldquo;mego&rdquo; was removed. Since it is
exceedingly bitter so liquid fat was poured over the &lsquo;mego&rsquo;.
The hyenas were shown the melting mego. At the sight, the hyenas
became panicky.<p>
Wamuthige,
after some thinking, called &ldquo;Kahuru,&rdquo; he said, please get
a thread and needle. Then come and knit out outlets tight so that
when we have eaten all this melting meat, we shall not water any. It
is so sweet and we can&rsquo;t afford to have delicacies waster.&rdquo;<p>
Kahuru,
being a kind-hearted family, went to fetch a needle and thread.
Meanwhile the hyenas ate nearly all the mego. When Kahuru returned
with the needle and thread he was asked to start his operation on the
hyenas.<p>
The
mego in the hyenas stomachs had intermingled with the meat and other
food. All the hyenas were suffering from flatulence. When Kahuru
started, the hyenas started to get stouter and stouter due to the air
in their stomachs. The hyenas brought their hindquarters as near to
Wakahuru as possible so that Wakahuru did not miss any. 
<p>
When
the hyenas were so swollen up that they could swell not more all
their back openings burst with pressure. All the stuff from inside
the hyenas liquid and solid, was deposited on him. So much was put
there, that he lay covered all over and helpless. The hyenas left
without helping Kahuru from his disgrace. Kahuru did not know what
had happened and anyway, he was not to blame.<p>
That
night, the rain fell in abundance and drenched the countryside.
Kahuru was cleaned. He flew to the nearest tree and perched there. In
the morning he found he could see and flew to his home.<p>
A
few weeks later Kahuru decided to give a feast especially for the
hyenas. He notified Wamuthige, who collected all the hyenas. The
party was to be in Kahuru&rsquo;s home. Kahuru was to carry all the
hyenas up, since hyenas don&rsquo;t fly. Kahuru chose a spot where
the hyenas could assemble, and told them to hold each other by the
tail. Then Kahuru would take Wamuthige who would be in the front.
Thus all the other hyenas would be pulled behind in along string.<p>
While
they were waiting, the hyenas hanced, singing.<p>
<i><b>We
are going up high to eat fat, fat meat,</b></i><p>
<i><b>And
we we say &lsquo;fat&rsquo;</b></i><p>
<i><b>We
mean meat purely white</b></i><p>
When
Kahuru arrived and picked up the first hyena all others followed
still singing happily. When they had flown up many miles, Kahuru
shouted at the last hyena, &ldquo;Can you still see the ground?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; was the reply. They flew on, still singing until
they could see the ground no longer.<p>
Then
Kahuru told the hyenas to stop singing and make ready for &ldquo;white&rdquo;
meat. Then all of a sudden, he let Wamuthige go, and through the air
the hyenas dropped. The fall was a great one. Kahuru flew down, and
from a safe distance, jeered teasingly at the groaning, fractured
cripples. Then he flew happily back to his home.<p>
